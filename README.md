Age Finder
This is a simple web project built with HTML and Vanilla JavaScript that calculates and displays a user's age based on their birth year.

Features
User inputs birth date via a date picker
On button click, the app calculates the approximate age (based on the current year)
Displays the age instantly on the page

How It Works
The user selects their birth date using the <input type="date"> element.
On clicking the Get button, JavaScript extracts the birth year.
It subtracts the birth year from the current year to compute the age.
The calculated age is displayed in an <h1> element.

Note: The age is based only on the year and does not account for the exact birth month or day.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
Vanilla JavaScript for age calculation and DOM interaction
